  <p>A team is defined as a group of people who perform interdependent tasks to 
    work toward accomplishing a common mission or specific objective. Some teams
     have a limited life: for example, 
    a design team developing a new product, or a continuous process improvement team
     organized to solve a particular problem.</p>
